## Core Principles

### What is a Changelog?

A changelog is a file containing a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

### Why Keep a Changelog?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| User awareness | Help users understand what changed |
| Upgrade decisions | Help users decide when to upgrade |
| Release tracking | Document release history |
| Team communication | Share changes across team |

### Guiding Principles

1. Changelogs are for **humans**, not machines
2. There should be an entry for **every version**
3. The same types of changes should be **grouped**
4. Versions and sections should be **linkable**
5. Latest version comes **first**
6. Release **date** of each version is displayed
7. Follow **Semantic Versioning**

---

## Changelog Format

### File Structure

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New features not yet released

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- Initial release with core features

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/user/repo/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD
[1.0.0]: https://github.com/user/repo/releases/tag/v1.0.0
```

### Version Header Format

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
```

Components:

- `X.Y.Z` - Semantic version number
- `YYYY-MM-DD` - ISO 8601 date format
- Square brackets for linkability

---

## Change Categories

### Standard Categories

Use these categories in this order:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Added** | New features | New API endpoint, new command |
| **Changed** | Changes to existing functionality | Modified behavior, updated dependency |
| **Deprecated** | Features marked for removal | Deprecated function, deprecated flag |
| **Removed** | Removed features | Deleted endpoint, removed command |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes | Corrected error, fixed crash |
| **Security** | Security fixes | Patched vulnerability, fixed auth issue |

### Category Guidelines

**Added:**

- New features, capabilities, or functionality
- New modules, commands, or API endpoints
- New configuration options

**Changed:**

- Modifications to existing functionality
- Updated dependencies (major versions)
- Changed default behaviors
- Renamed items

**Deprecated:**

- Features that will be removed in future versions
- Include migration path when possible
- Specify target removal version if known

**Removed:**

- Features that have been removed
- Only use after deprecation period (when possible)

**Fixed:**

- Bug corrections
- Error handling improvements
- Performance fixes

**Security:**

- Security vulnerability fixes
- Authentication/authorization fixes
- Data protection improvements
- Include CVE numbers when applicable

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Entry Format

**Good entries:**

```markdown
- Added `--verbose` flag to enable detailed output (#123)
- Fixed crash when processing empty files
- Changed default timeout from 30s to 60s
- Deprecated `OldFunction()` in favor of `NewFunction()`
```

**Bad entries:**

```markdown
- Fixed bug  # Too vague
- Various improvements  # Not specific
- Updated code  # Meaningless
- Bumped version  # Not user-relevant
```

### Style Guidelines

| Guideline | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Use imperative mood | "Add feature" not "Added feature" in commits, but "Added" in changelog |
| Start with verb | "Fixed", "Added", "Removed" |
| Be specific | Name the function, command, or feature |
| Include references | Issue numbers, PR links |
| Keep entries concise | One line per change |

### What to Include

**Include:**

- User-facing changes
- API changes
- Breaking changes
- Security fixes
- Significant bug fixes
- Deprecation notices

**Exclude:**

- Internal refactoring (unless affecting performance)
- Development tooling changes
- Minor dependency updates
- Typo fixes (unless in user-facing content)
- CI/CD changes (unless affecting releases)

### Reference Linking

```markdown
- Fixed authentication bypass vulnerability ([CVE-2026-1234])
- Added new export command (#456)
- Changed configuration format (see [Migration Guide])

[CVE-2026-1234]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-1234
[Migration Guide]: docs/migration.md
```

## Version Numbering

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

|-----------|-------------------|
| MAJOR | Breaking/incompatible API changes |
| MINOR | New functionality (backwards-compatible) |
| PATCH | Bug fixes (backwards-compatible) |

## Special Formats

### Ansible/antsibull-changelog Format

For Ansible collections using antsibull-changelog:

```yaml
---
release_summary: "Brief 1-2 sentence overview of this release"
added:
  - "role_name - Added new feature X"
  - "module_name - Added Y capability"
changed:
  - "role_name - Enhanced Z functionality"
fixed:
  - "role_name - Fixed issue with W"
```

**Rules for antsibull-changelog:**

- `release_summary` is a single string, not a list
- All other categories are lists of strings
- Prefix changes with module/role/plugin name
- Use past tense: "Added", "Enhanced", "Fixed"
- Output only raw YAML content

---
